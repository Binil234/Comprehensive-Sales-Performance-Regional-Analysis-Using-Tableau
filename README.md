📊 Sales Performance & Regional Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to understand sales trends, regional performance, and product behavior. Using Excel, PostgreSQL, and Tableau, raw data was transformed into meaningful insights through data cleaning, querying, statistical analysis, and interactive visualizations.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and prepare raw sales-related datasets

Integrate multiple data sources into a unified model

Analyze sales, revenue, and stock performance

Identify trends across time, regions, stores, and products

Present insights using interactive dashboards

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and integration

PostgreSQL – SQL querying, aggregations, rollups, and data analysis

Tableau – Data modeling, visualizations, and dashboards

📂 Data Description

The project uses the following datasets:

sales.xlsx – Sales transactions, revenue, stock, and dates

product_hierarchy.xlsx – Product category hierarchy

product_names.xlsx – Product details

store_names.xlsx – Store information

store_cities.xlsx – Store-to-city mapping

city_names.xlsx – City details

All datasets were cleaned and linked using common identifiers such as product_id, store_id, and city_id.

📊 Key Analysis & Visualizations

Sales trends over time using line charts

Regional and store-level performance using bar charts and packed bubbles

Product-level analysis using scatter plots and sunburst charts

Stock vs sales relationship analysis

Regression analysis to study sales behavior over time

📈 Key Insights

Sales performance varies significantly across regions and stores

A small number of stores contribute the majority of revenue

High stock levels do not always result in higher sales

Time alone is not a strong predictor of sales performance

✅ Recommendations

Focus resources on high-performing cities and stores

Optimize inventory levels to avoid overstocking

Improve or re-evaluate low-performing products

Use dashboards for continuous performance monitoring

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete business intelligence workflow—from raw data to actionable insights. By combining data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, statistical techniques, and interactive Tableau dashboards, the project highlights how data-driven decision-making can improve sales strategy and operational efficiency.
